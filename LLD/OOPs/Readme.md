# History of Programming

Programming has evolved step by step, starting from very basic instructions for machines to advanced concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs).

---

## 1. Machine Language (1st Generation)
- Written in **binary (0s and 1s)**.
- Very hard for humans to read and write.
- Directly understood by the computer hardware.  
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: `10110000 01100001`

---

## 2. Assembly Language (2nd Generation)
- Used **mnemonics (short codes)** instead of binary.
- Easier for humans but still close to hardware.
- Needed an **assembler** to convert into machine code.  
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: `MOV A, 5`

---

## 3. High-Level Languages (3rd Generation)
- More human-friendly, closer to English.
- Portable across machines.
- Needed a **compiler or interpreter**.
- Examples: **C, FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Example in C:
  ```c
  printf("Hello World");
  ```
---

## 4. Structured Programming

- Introduced the idea of breaking programs into functions and procedures.
- Made programs easier to read, debug, and maintain.
  ðŸ‘‰ Example Languages: C, Pascal

 ---

## 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

- Focuses on objects that combine data (fields) and behavior (methods).
- Supports concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
- Makes software modular, reusable, and easier to scale.
  ðŸ‘‰ Example Languages: C++, Java, Python (supports OOP)

```java
class Car {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

```
